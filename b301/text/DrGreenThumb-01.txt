Like oil and water
Mixed at the right time, and perfection results
And then they return to their natural state
The machine is impressive
Yet, we are set apart and left to our emotions
Or should I say, our sense of emotion, because the machine dictates the emotions, and we are free
Right in the middle of that dilemma

To your question - I am trying not to care
