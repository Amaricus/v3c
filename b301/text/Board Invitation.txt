Dear Brendan,

I have observed you grow in wisdom, age, and grace and offer you delayed congratulations on your graduation from Gonzaga University.

Whatever profession you embrace I am confident you will be a very positive influence.
Treacy-Levine Center is about to launch programs to meet the needs of people.  We have a Board of about 12 people who meet about 8 times a year at 10:00am on Saturday morning for approximately 2 hours.  The primary purpose of the Board is fun raising but also to review and evaluate programs and staff.  Your talents and views would be most helpful if you would consider membership.  At your convenience I am ready to give you any information you may need to help you with your decision.

Sincerely,
Father William Treacy
