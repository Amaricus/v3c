As I look back at the road of life I see two roads leading me to priesthood
One had its beginning in a field called the "six acre" field owned by my family
At one time there were many trees in it
The area was remote
People gathered there for Mass, sheltered by the trees, when a priest was available during the 18th century
Catholics refused to accept the decision of King Henry VIII in the 16th century to sever relations with Pope and England were regarded as traitors with no right to practice our religion
It was only in 1829 that the British Parliament granted Emancipation to CatholicsThat explains why my ancestors had to find an area, remote from British authority, to attend Mass
There was a price on a priest's head if caught celebrating mass

On June 19, 1944, I cycled to the small local church to celebrate my first MassI paused at the six-acre field next to the road to say a prayer of thanks to my ancestors for their devotion to their faith
The Mass Pit, as it was called, always spoke to me of devoted priests and people loving Mass
The second road to the priesthood was Sunday Mass in the local churchFrom a five-mile area people flocked to Sunday MassSome walked across fields on what was called "Mass paths"
Most came in donkey 0 or horse-drawn carts; other, on bicycles
If a family was absent the conclusion was that this was due to illness
Nothing else would account for their absence

As a tennager I began to see a greater significance in the massIt gave a persepective, a purpose, to the lives of those who attended
Poverty, hard work, emigration, death and illness were part of lifeSunday Mass helped people to cope with the daily challenges
The thought came to me that i could help give purpose and comfort to people as a priest
As a young altar server I observed the funeral Mass offering hope to the grieving
With this persepective I entered Ireland's National Seminary in 1937 and was ordained a priest seven years later

The British Air Force had tried to recruit youth of my age during the war, appealing to an idealism they knew we had
Several my age were pilots during the battle of Britain
But my class, with the exception of five or six, were ordained June 18th 1944, during the Normandy invasion

As I walked out of the Seminary chapel, one of fifty newly-ordained, parents were standing at each side of the aisle in the seminary chapel
I wept
But I was not alone
Every mother I observed was also crying, watching a son to whom she gave life, now ready to begin a new life, that like some of us would take us thousands of miles away to help minister to the lives of others, in anew ways such as for me to team up with a rabbi born in Russia
Now, after 70 years as a priest, most of my friends are gone
One has remained who was with me and planted ideas of priesthood in my heart
Jesus, in his farewell to priests in John's Gospel 15:16, said, "It was not you who chose me.  It was I who chose you to go forth and bear fruit."
For that call I am most grateful
I pray that anyone I hurt, through forgiveness, may come closer to God
To Jesus, my love and thanks; and also to all of you who have helped me in some way during the past 70 years
May God bless you
