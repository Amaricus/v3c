It is Easter week - a very special week.
The first one to the tomb was Mary.
She looked into the tomb, saw the angels - and was soon to see the Christ.
She wondered what all this meant.
She was lifted beyond herself.
The disciples met Jesus on the road - and only slowly, in the breaking of the bread, recognized him.
They were in wonder - and they could not believe it.

In today's Gospel, the disciples were reeling with an un-understandable mystery.
The man they had loved - and served so cowardly - had suddenly appeared out of death.
In their confusion, they sought the only thing they knew: the Lake, the early rise of the sun, the search for fish - 
and then wonders of wonders, he was there, inviting them into a new life, a new world - a mysterious wonder 

Wonder:  It could be our greatest emotion - and it is happening in the midst of the closest followers of Christ.
Never before and never again will they be this close to experiencing the essence of life.
Wonder and seeking seem to go together.  We do not really need the answer.  it is the journey that counts.

This is important.  You do not really want to get off your journey - this wonder; and just have answers.

Why do we become so atached to fixed positions; when standing on the edge, questioning, investigating, reahing out, seeking - full of wonderment-
is the real richness - and it is there where we find the life.

To be not so sure, to feel your mind changing, being drawn into areas where you have never gone before.
this is the real search that gives you the real life.

In such moments come the opening of truth. 
We leap with joy and new hope.

Nourish this wonder, nourish this seeking.
It is the great gift.

Here it is popping in the life of Christ's followers.
It could well be given to you if you are able to look into the tomb- walk the road, untraveled.
be with Christ in the mystery of everyday life and see that Christ did this for you.
